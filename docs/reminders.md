# Reminders

These are development reminders when implementing certain functionality across the platform.

## Creating New Taxonomies
- Remember to add to the `Content->Manage Taxonomy` menu if site admins should be able to add to it.
- Remember to set proper permissions for that taxonomy for site admins if they should be able to add their own.
